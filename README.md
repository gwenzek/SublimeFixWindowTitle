[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gwenzek/SublimeSetWindowTitle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gwenzek/SublimeSetWindowTitle)

## Overview

**!!! You probably don't need this plugin anymore in ST4 !!!**
Just set `"show_project_first": true,` in your preferences.

This plugin allows you to configure the title of your Sublime Text windows.
Every time you switch view, save a view, start editing a view,
it will update the window title.

## Installation

This package is avalaible on [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io/).
If you have an unregistered version of Sublime Text you need to set the
setting "unregistered" to `true` (or to buy a license!).

## Requirement

On Windows it should work out of the box.
On Linux the plugin assumes you have installed `xdotool`.
If you have any ideas on how to do that on MacOS, please submit a PR.

## Configuration

Please look at the [settings](./set_window_title.sublime-settings) to read the
documentation.

## Room for improvement

* Doesn't work with workspaces, it would be easy to implement if ST had a
better API for this (relevant issues:
[826](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/826),
[5](https://github.com/gwenzek/SublimeSetWindowTitle/issues/5))

* Currently the code that modifies the window title needs the PID of the
  target window. As there is no ST API for that, we list all ST windows and
  rename the one with a name matching the expected name.
  If there was a reliable way to find the PID of the correct window then we
  could drop the `get_official_name` method, and simplify the plugin a lot.

* (Linux) For some reason some chars aren't displayed correctly.

* (Windows) The plugin is more brittle on Windows, some features have been
disabled as a consequence.
In particular you'll have to manually select windows before their name is changed.
If you have knowledge of the `user32` API we might use your help !

## Thanks
